# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Application description 
This is an Vit/ Typescript application which runs purely in the browser. No backend is used or needed. This application allows the user to easily print leaflets from using a regular office printer. For this reason, the UI allows the user to edit the content and styles of 4 pages and print them easily in leaflet format. 

## Core development rules
Before you write code, make a plan and run it by me. Do not add any packages on your own. I will always specifically state which packages you should use. Do not assume I want anything extra, always ask.
